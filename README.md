# Gather Clone

[Watch the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnhsC7Fmt20)

A clone of Gather.town featuring fully customizable spaces and seamless proximity based video chat.

The project is a fork of Realms, my previous project inspired by Gather. You can check it out [here.](https://github.com/trevorwrightdev/realms)

The app was designed to include the core features of Gather, including:

- Customizable spaces using tilesets
- Proximity video chat
- Private area video chat 
- Multiplayer networking
- Tile-based movement

Built as a TypeScript web app primarily using Next.js, Supabase, Socket.io, TailwindCSS, Pixi.js, and Agora for video chat. 

### How to install

First, clone the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/trevorwrightdev/gather-clone.git`

Install client dependencies.
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Install server dependencies.
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

The project requires both Supabase and Agora - you'll need to create projects in both platforms.

Create a .env file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
```
FRONTEND_URL=
SUPABASE_URL=
SERVICE_ROLE=
```

Create a .env.local file in the `frontend` directory with the following variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=
SERVICE_ROLE=
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=
APP_CERTIFICATE=
```

Lastly, run `npm run dev` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories.

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel, Railway, and other platforms. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

### Live Demo

The application will be available at your deployed URL once configured with proper environment variables.
